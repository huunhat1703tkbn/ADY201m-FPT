    "Jupyter notebook is a language-agnostic HTML notebook application for Project Jupyter. In 2015, Jupyter notebook was released as a part of The Big Split™ of the IPython codebase. IPython 3 was the last major monolithic release containing both language-agnostic code, such as the <i>IPython notebook</i>, and language specific code, such as the <i>IPython kernel for Python</i>. As computing spans across many languages, Project Jupyter will continue to develop the language-agnostic <b>Jupyter notebook </b>  in this repo and with the help of the community develop language specific kernels which are found in their own discrete repos.\n",
